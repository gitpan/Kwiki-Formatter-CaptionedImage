Kwiki-Formatter-CaptionedImage

Extends the Kwiki syntax to allow a captioned image to be easily specified.
It works like a titled external link except a the link points to an image.
So for example:

   [http://foo.com/images/bar.gif An image of a Footastic product]

By default will center the captioned image with text cleared on both sides
but also has options to float the image left or right and allow the text to
flow around the image.
